####   Portfolio Assignment
### Overview 


This is the updated portfolio that I created during my first assignment in the Ga Tech Coding Camp.  I will keep a running tab of my progress and coding activity here for future employment.  Adding links to things I have created and some top homework assignments will be how it starts. Then as I grow as a developer I will be able to showcase more detailed works that I was a part of creating, have contributed to, or created myself.   




# What I Learned 

I learned that coding will forever be a dynamic and ever changing experience.  The more I learn the more I can change and improve the quality of work I can showcase and output for clients.  I learned how to style some more basics and that my resume needs a lot more work than I had to put into it.  This will also be something I can always improve on.
