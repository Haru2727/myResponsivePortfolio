    This site is a bio and an ongoing portfolio page for me to be able to show how my skills are enhancing in coding.  I will be using Bootstrap CSS framework top start it off, and adding more to it as the course moves forward. My objective is to show that I am capable of devleoping a mobile app and/or enhancing an exisitng application by adding a responsive design.  The goal for this is to create a site that has my bio, contact information, and future portfolio accessible to potenial employers.  I must create a responsive layout, with images, and a navbar that work within the framework.  This is was more of a confusing task rather than being on the diffuclt side of the scale.  Using the html validator also thought me that I can't just put semantics where ever.


                                                                 <<<<<<<What I Learned>>>>>>>

    Using bootstrap css and its framework was a fun way to learn how to make things fit into a layout and conform with the standards of app building today.  Making the layout was not an easy task.  Even when using examples from the class I mixed things up when moving around rows and columns.  It took me a lot of tries to mimic the activity in class even with it right in front of me.  This showed me how important it is to have good framework so when it switches over to a different device it can still hold its structure.  Another important item learned was the commit early and often along with comments.  This still being a new way of transfering information to me still hasn't become a second nature habibt, but every time I do it I believe my comments and effieceny are getting better.  This is a lesson in learning how to work with a team and keep information flowing.  The html validation gave me some more lessons that just putting semantics that aren't labeled with div isn't the right way.  There is an order to it that allows for the code to be broken down the correct way.
