                    <p>Translated into Arash the Archer, my name comes from an old folk tale told for many generations
                        in Iran.</p>
                    <p>Thousands of years ago, a legendary bowman named Arash was sent by the shah to fire an arrow from
                        the top of a mountain</p>
                    <p>to redfine the Persian Empires border. The mighty archer waited til dawn to fire, giving it
                        everything he had.</p>
                    <p>The archer sacrficed himself, he put so much into the shot that he died instantly. The arrow
                        traveled a thousand leagues</p>
                    <p>before landing. This story helped fuel the passion for the Persian empire and had such an impact
                        that</p>
                    <p>until today many children are still named after the legendary hero.</p>

                <dd class="col-sm-9">
                    <p>My father immigrated here from Iran in the 1970's.  During those times most immigrants from Iran either went to Los
                        Angeles, or to New</p><p> York City.  He chose NYC which is how I grew up in New Jersey for the first part of my life.  From 1984 til 1999
                        I lived in New Jersey.  Some</p><p> of my fondest memories of those times are when i used to go to work with my dad and we got to be in the city 
                        all day, enjoying the</p><p> diverse choices of food and the freedom that only a child of the 90's can understand.  I got to explore and venture
                        off here and there at</p><p> time before cell phones and having to be on constant contact.  In the late 90's he came into some hard times up there 
                        and with the </p><p>advice and job offer from a close friend he decided it was time to move the family to Alpharetta, Ga.  My first few months in the south 
                        </p><p>had a shell shock effect on me.  In the north everything is so compact I could walk or ride my bicycle anywhere a child could need.  
                        In </p><p>Alpharetta that was not the case.   I slowly adapted to my new surroundings especially once I got my drivers lisence.  After college and a</p><p> few years of 
                        saving I bought myself a condo in Atlanta.  I bought into a neighborhood that allows me to walk or bike to anything I need. </p> Atlanta feels like home more than ever now.
