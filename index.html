                    <p>Named after Arash e Kamangir, translated into Arash the Archer, my name comes from an old folk
                        tale told for many
                        generations in Iran. Thousands of years ago, a legendary bowman named Arash was sent by the shah
                        to fire an arrow
                        from the top of a mountain to redfine the Persian Empires border. The mighty archer waited til
                        dawn to fire, giving it
                        everything he had. The archer sacrficed himself, he put so much into the shot that he died
                        instantly. The arrow
                        traveled a thousand leagues before landing. This story helped fuel the passion for the Persian
                        empire and had such an
                        impact that until today many children are still named after the legendary hero.</p>

                    <p>My father immigrated here from Iran in the 1970's. During those times most immigrants from
                        Iran either went to Los Angeles, or to New York City. He chose NYC which is how I grew up in New
                        Jersey for the first part of my life.
                        From 1984 til 1999 I lived in New Jersey. Some of my fondest memories of those times are when i
                        used to go to work with my dad and we got
                        to be in the city all day, enjoying the diverse choices of food and the freedom that only a
                        child of the 90's can understand. I got
                        to explore and venture off here and there at time before cell phones and having to be on
                        constant contact. In the late 90's he came into
                        some hard times up there and with the advice and job offer from a close friend he decided it was
                        time to move the family to
                        Alpharetta, Ga. My first few months in the south had a shell shock effect on me. In the north
                        everything is so compact I could walk or ride
                        my bicycle anywhere a child could need. In Alpharetta that was not the case. I slowly adapted to
                        my new surroundings especially once I
                        got my drivers lisence. After college and a few years of saving I bought myself a condo in
                        Atlanta. I bought into a neighborhood that allows me to
                        walk or bike to anything I need. Atlanta feels like home more than ever now.
